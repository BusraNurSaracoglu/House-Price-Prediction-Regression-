# House-Price-Prediction-Regression-Problem

I preapared an programme in Python to predict house prices. In this project, I try to predict the house sales in King County, Washington State, USA using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

This is a great dataset for evaluating simple regression models. The dataset consisted of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015. 

First, I made an EDA for this dataset, and used feature engineering for make dataset to better train with our model. Than, I trained the model and calculated the error metrics, like MAE (mean absolute error), MSE (mean squared error), rmse (rounded mean squared error) and r2 score.
